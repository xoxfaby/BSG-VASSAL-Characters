Battlestar Galactica Board Game - Custom Character Card Templates

1.Introduction:

After some time making custom character cards out of the templates and files uploaded by BoardGameGeek user acadmiat, I ran into the limitations that stemmed mainly from his making the templates before the various expansions came out. There were numerous skill card draws missing - notably any Treachery at all and many multi-skill draws - as well as no Cylon Leader characters and an inability to easily account for different ability/weakness text box sizes. With the kind permission of acadamiat I have used some of his excellent files (character backgrounds for cards, player and pilot tokens) as well as extensive work on scans of my own cards to create new templates, for quickly knocking together quality custom characters.

2.Instructions:

- To use the templates, you will need to download the GIMP (a free, open-source Image Manipulation Program similar to photoshop), but you won't need much knowledge or skill in image manipulation or using GIMP. You will also need to install the fonts from this package. With GIMP installed, you can open the character template, and easily enter the specifics of your custom character. 

2.A - CHARACTER TEMPLATE

- In the layers toolbox, you can select the character type by making the relevant layer visible (click to the left of the layer name to toggle the visibility 'eye' symbol.)

- Using the text tool, you can select and over-write the placeholder text for the character name, ability, miracle abililty, weakness, and setup location. You may have to select the right layer in the layer toolbox first.

- Select the Abilities Divider layer and use the move tool to drag (or highlight and then move with the arrow keys for precision) the divider up and down to balance your ability and weakness text areas.

- Paste a character headshot as a new layer (an easy way to do that is to drag an image file onto your open template in GIMP), position and scale it as necessary, and use the layers toolbox to make sure it is behind the frame layer and in front of the background layer. Do this by clicking and dragging the image layer up and down the list of layers to a position just below the frame layer (you may have to right-click and select 'anchor layer' first.) If you want to have the character stand in front of the Galactica bulkhead background (or Cylon basestar bridge background for Cylon Leaders) you'll need to carefully cut them out of the source image, GIMP has tools for this if you want to give it a shot.

- One by one paste the skill card draws you require as new layers (see above), and position them behind the frame layer at the bottom right of the headshot pane. It's easiest to have the bottom skill type be the frontmost, and each higher one behind the one below.

- Save the finished card and export it to a suitable image format to share or print it (best on quality cardstock), then cut it out and have a go!

2.B - PLAYER TOKEN TEMPLATE

- For a Cylon Leader character, make the Cylon Leader background layer visible (toggle the 'eye' visibility icon in the layers toolbox) to use the Cylon basestar bridge background. For a human, leave it invisible to use the Galactica bulkhead background.

- Paste a character headshot as a new layer (an easy way to do that is to drag an image file onto your open template in GIMP), position and scale it as necessary, and use the layers toolbox to make sure it is behind the base layer and in front of the background layer(s). Do this by clicking and dragging the image layer up and down the list of layers to a position just below the frame layer (you may have to right-click and select 'anchor layer' first.) If you want to have the character stand in front of the Galactica bulkhead/Cylon basestar background you'll need to carefully cut them out of the source image, GIMP has tools for this if you want to give it a shot.

- Save the finished token and export it to a suitable image format to share or print it. This works best by printing two copies on paper, cutting them out and and sticking them to eitherr side of a piece of thick cardboard. Cut out the cardboard and hey presto.

2.C - PILOTING TOKEN TEMPLATE

- Use the elliptical selection tool in GIMP to select a circular area that just covers the token face.

- With this circular area selected, paste a character mugshot as a new layer (an easy way to do that is to drag an image file onto your open template in GIMP),  and position and scale it as necessary. If you want to have the character stand in front of the red textured background you'll need to carefully cut them out of the source image, GIMP has tools for this if you want to give it a shot.

- Save the finished token and export it to a suitable image format to share or print it. This works best by printing two copies on paper, cutting them out and and sticking them to eitherr side of a piece of thick cardboard. Cut out the cardboard and hey presto.

3.Acknowledgements

- My personal thanks to acadamiat from the BGG community for making his awesome templates, and then again for letting me re-use some of his work on them to avoid reinventing the wheel on my own.

- A huge thank you to Sci-Fi, Ron Moore, FFG, and all who were responsible for the awesome Battlestar Galactica TV show and Board Game.
